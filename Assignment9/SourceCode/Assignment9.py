PROBLEM:
This week youâ€™ll read in a datafile containing crime information for 2019.  
You will need to create the functions given below with the function signature given.  
Function signature means the definition of the name of the function as well as any parameters and return values.  
There will again be a unit test file to assist you.Each one will also show an example in the shell.  
Once you write a function you can just hit F5 and then call the function from the shell to test it with different values.

ALGORITHM:
There are 12 functions. 
month_from_number():Finds the corresponding string to a month's number.
read_in_file():It reads the file given by the user and then outputs the contents of the file.
askfile():Asks the user for a file name and outputs that name.
create_reported_date_dict():takes a list, which is the list of lists returned from the read_in_file function above and returns a dictionary where the key is a date of the year found in index 1, 
    and the value is how many times a crime occurred on that data as read from the file.
create_reported_month_dict():The create_reported_month_dictfunction takes a list, which is the list of lists returned from the read_in_file function above and returns a dictionary where the key is the month of the offense,
     and the value is how many times a crime occurred on that data as read from the file.
create_offense_dict():Function takes a list, and returns a dictionary where the key the offense (Arson, Burglary, etc)
    and the value is how many times that offense occurs.
create_offense_by_zip():This function takes a list, it is the list returned from read_in_file function and returns a dictionary where the key the offense (Arson, Burglary, etc) and the value is another dictionary. 
    This sub dictionary has a key for the zip code, and a value that is how many times this offense occurs in this zip code.
maxmonth():Finds the month with the most amount of crime and returns it.
maxmonthcrime():Returns the amount of crime for the month that has the most
topoffensecount():Gets the crime with the most offenses and finds the number of offenses from that crime. Returns both the crime and the number of offenses.
crimefind():Has the user enter a crime. The function checks to make sure the crime is in the list and returns the user's inputted crime.
printcrime():Prints the offenses of the user given crime per zipcode.
The main function is where all the functions are called.

ERROR HANDLING:
I used a try/except block to catch any filenotfound/IOErrors when getting the file. Other than that I used while loops to catch any other errors.

OTHER COMMENTS:
There's a couple functions I think I could combine with more time and coding knowledge.
